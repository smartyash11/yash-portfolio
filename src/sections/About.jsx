                I'm a passionate student of B.Tech in Information Technology at Manipal University Jaipur, where I am building a strong foundation in core computer science subjects such as data structures, algorithms, databases, and software engineering, while working extensively with Python and SQL.
              </p>
              <p>
              I am actively exploring the Generative AI space along with data engineering and automation, focusing on building practical, domain-specific AI solutions in areas such as legal-tech and education. 
              My work involves intelligent search, AI-driven research, content generation, ETL pipelines, and large-scale data processing, with an emphasis on designing scalable, production-ready systems.
              I am also a winner of the National RoboCup 2019 and had the honor of representing my country at the RoboCup 2019 World Finals in Sydney
              </p>
              <p>
                When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies,
                contributing to open-source projects, or sharing knowledge with
                the developer community.
